MPG Regression
----------------
I used a multiple linear regression of the MechaCar_mpg data to determine if any of the variables have a statistical correlation. mpg is our dependent variable, while vehicle.length, vehicle.weight, spoiler.angle, and ground.clearance are independent variables that will be part of the multiple linear regression.  Our results were:

Coefficients:
                   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)      -1.076e+02  1.576e+01  -6.823 1.87e-08 ***
vehicle.length    6.240e+00  6.609e-01   9.441 3.05e-12 ***
vehicle.weight    1.277e-03  6.948e-04   1.837   0.0728 .  
spoiler.angle     8.031e-02  6.656e-02   1.207   0.2339    
ground.clearance  3.659e+00  5.394e-01   6.784 2.13e-08 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

Residual standard error: 8.853 on 45 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7032,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6768 
F-statistic: 26.65 on 4 and 45 DF,  p-value: 2.277e-11

The t-value for vehicle.length and ground.clearance show that these variables are significantally associated to MPG and provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values,  while vehicle.weight and spoiler.angle are not.  

Since the P-value, is less than the significant value of .05, we reject the null hypothesis and therefore the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

The R-Squared value, of 0.7032, shows that 70% of the variance found with variables predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effictively.

Suspension Coil Summary
-----------------------
  Num_of_Vehicles PSI_mean PSI_median PSI_variance   PSI_sd
1             150 1499.531   1499.747     76.23459 8.731242

The summary shows that there is no skewing of the data since the mean and median are almost the same.  Also, the PSI_variance with the PSU_sd show that the current manufacturing data meets the design specification of the suspension coils not exceeding 100 psi.

Suspension Coil T-Test
----------------------

One Sample t-test

data:  suspension_coil$PSI
t = -0.65784, df = 149, p-value = 0.5117
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1498.122 1500.940
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1499.531 
 
The True Mean is not equal to 1500 and since the p-value is greater then the signifcance level of 0.05, there is no statistical difference between the means

Design your own study
---------------------
If I was to design my own study, the metrics I would also look at would include fuel efficiency of the car, tank size, type of car, amount of seats, cost of the car and average repair costs.

My question would be what variables contribute to the buyers decision to purhcase the car.

Null hypothesis = None of the variable correlate to the buyers decision to buy the car.

Alternative Hypothesis = Some of the variables contribute to the buyers decision to buy a car.

We would need to gather data from car lots and determine what factors they see contribute to the sale.  We can then use a t.test to determine the p-value and see if there is any correlation between the decision and the variables.
